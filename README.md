> LiveBoardManiaâ€™s Racing Bet Card Widget displays race betting data and allows easy filtering by odds and amount.

## Prerequisites

I have been working on this project using NodeJS (version 20.14.0 or later) and NPM (version 10.7.0).
To make sure you have them available on your machine,
try running the following command.

```sh
$ npm -v && node -v
10.7.0
v20.14.0
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Installation

To install and set up the library, run:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Or if you prefer using Yarn(I used yarn):

```sh
$ yarn install
```

## Usage

### Serving the app

```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### Building a distribution version

```sh
$ npm run build
```

This task will create a distribution version of the project
inside your local `dist/` folder
